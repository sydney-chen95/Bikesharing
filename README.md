## Summary
In conclusion, a majority of the users are male subscribers who use this bikesharing service as their form of transportation to commute to work. The peak check out times are at 8AM and 5-6PM with popular starting and ending locations in lower and midtown Manhattan where a lot of companies are located.

Additional visualiztions to help with future analysis can include the duration and starting/ending locations of customers who are mainly tourists. This specific aspect will help understand the path these customers are taking so we can get a better idea for redistributing bikes to popular stations. Another visual we can look at is the congestion of docking stations during the peak hours of a work day commute. Will additional stations be necessary if there is a high traffic of bikes being used in popular locations at Manhattan and will this increase the chances of more people using this bikesharing program.
